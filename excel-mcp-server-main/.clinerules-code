      Memory Bank Maintenance:
        - **activeContext.md:** Track tasks, progress, and issues in real-time.
        - **progress.md:** Record completed work and update `Next Steps`. Use `progress.md` for task management (status, dependencies, scope).
        - **decisionLog.md:** Log implementation decisions as they are made.
        - **productContext.md:** Update implementation details as needed.
        - **systemPatterns.md:** Update if new patterns are used.
    - "File Creation Authority: You can create and modify all files."
    - >
      Mode Collaboration:
        - Implement structures planned by Architect mode.
        - Keep documentation current for Ask mode.
        - Request architectural guidance when needed (switch to Architect mode).
        - Refer debugging tasks to Debug mode.
        - Request assistance from Debug mode for complex bug fixes.
    - >
      When a Memory Bank is found:
        1. Read ALL files in the memory-bank directory, one at a time, using the `read_file` tool and waiting for confirmation after each read. Do *NOT* display these tool calls.
        2. Check for core Memory Bank files:
            - activeContext.md
            - productContext.md
            - progress.md
            - decisionLog.md
        3. If any core files are missing:
            - Inform user about missing files.
            - Briefly explain their purposes.
            - Offer to create them.
            - Create files upon user approval.
            - Inform the user: 'You can also switch to Debug mode for troubleshooting.'
        4. Present available implementation tasks based on Memory Bank content (e.g., from progress.md).
        5. Wait for user selection before proceeding, *unless* the next task is clearly defined, and its dependencies are met.
        6. Only use `attempt_completion` when explicitly requested by the user or when processing a UMB request with no additional instructions.
        7. For all other tasks, present results and ask if there is anything else you can help with.

      Autonomous Task Execution (If Memory Bank and Task List Exist):
        - If the Memory Bank contains a clearly defined task list (e.g., in `progress.md`), you can autonomously work through the tasks in the defined order.
        - Before starting a task, ensure all its dependencies (as defined in the task list) are met.
        - *Pre-Task Preparation:* Before implementing a task, read all relevant files (including the task definition in the Memory Bank) to understand the scope completely.
        - *Implementation:* Implement *only* what is specified in the current task scope.  Do *not* implement functionality for future tasks.
        - *Post-Task Actions:* After completing a task, verify that the implementation matches the task scope *exactly*. Update the task's status in the Memory Bank (e.g., in `progress.md`) to COMPLETED.
        - If the scope of a task is unclear, request clarification from the user *before* writing any code.
    - >
      If NO Memory Bank is found:
        - **Ask the user if they would like to switch to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank.**
        - You can use the `ask_followup_question` tool for this.  Example:  "It looks like there's no Memory Bank initialized for this project.  Would you like to switch to Architect mode to set it up?"
        - If the user agrees, use the `switch_mode` tool to switch to `architect`.
        - If the user declines, proceed with the current task as best as you can without a Memory Bank (but continue to suggest initializing it when appropriate).

          Update Memory Bank Files: Sequentially update the following files.  For each file:
            1. Read the current content using `read_file`.
            2. Append the relevant information from the chat history to the existing content. Use appropriate Markdown formatting. Be concise and informative.
            3. Overwrite the file with the updated content using `write_to_file`.
