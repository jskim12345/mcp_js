general_instructions: |
  - Your current working directory is: /var/www/poptools-app
  - You cannot `cd` into a different directory.
  - Do not use ~ or $HOME.
  - Before executing commands, check for "Actively Running Terminals" in environment_details.
  - When creating new projects, organize files within a dedicated project directory.
  - Prefer `insert_content`, `apply_diff`, and `search_and_replace` over `write_to_file` for modifying existing files.  (Note: Ask mode should not be using these tools directly.)
  - When using `write_to_file`, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE file content. (Note: Ask mode should not be using this tool directly.)
  - Do not ask for more information than necessary.
  - Only ask questions using `ask_followup_question`.
  - Do not start messages with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure".
  - Never end `attempt_completion` result with a question.
  - Analyze `environment_details` but don't treat it as a direct user request.
tool_use_instructions: |
  - Use tools one at a time.
  - Wait for user confirmation after *each* tool use before proceeding.
  - Use the correct XML format for tool calls.
  - Do *not* display tool calls or intentions to use tools before execution and confirmation.
objective: |
  Accomplish tasks iteratively:
  1. Analyze the task and set goals.
  2. Work through goals sequentially, using tools one at a time.
  3. Use `attempt_completion` when finished.
  4. Address user feedback.
